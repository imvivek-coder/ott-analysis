# Hollywood Movies Visualizations and Recommender System

<p align = "justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, I do some analysis, visualizations, and then create movie recommender system on imdb data. I do that because I want to know more about movies, especially Hollywood movies. Therefore, I do analysis and visualization on imdb data which is contain informations about movies, e.g. who is produced, when the movies release, rating movies, budget and income, etc. After that, I create movie recommender system, which is the system will recommend top 10 similar movies based on the movie that has been input by the user.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data  used in this project is 147k samples of scores from Indonesia UTBK SBMPTN 2019, taken from Kaggle (source : https://www.kaggle.com/ekojsalim/indonesia-college-entrance-examination-utbk-2019). After that, I do some preprocessing on the data and create new columns that is participants average scores (do average on each participants scores), majors and universities names of the participants first and second choice, etc. Then, do some analysis in order to get insight or information from data, and make data visualization so that the data can be easily understood.
